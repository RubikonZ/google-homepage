In this project we create webpage which mimics google homepage
Project is somewhat finished, during my work I used Firefox's DevTools a lot to analyze and become familiar with their frontpage structure.
In CSS I mostly used flexbox to achieve my goal, and also tried to keep structure simple (and tried to use as little 'div's as I could)
Both html and css were done in VSCode through WSL2. also this README.md being written through bash
